# 3. Values and types

## Basic data types

We can note that these are the fundamental data types found in many
programming language. However, we need to mention new types integration to
the language, to improve syntax and prorgamming accross precision,
optimization, and diversity.

- `string`

- `int` (, int32, int64, int128, int256, etc...)

- `real` (, r32, r64, r128, r256, etc...)

- `complex`

- `quaternion`

- `bool`

- `arr` for array

- `none`

Note: There is interoperability between numerical types (i.e. `int`, `real`,
`complex`, and `quaternion`).

This suggests that the basic operators can be applied in between them without any problem.

## Numeric operations and interoperability

Here we'll discuss about type compatibility with some operations and tell more details on interaction between types and operations (interoperability).

## Numeric promotion

Numeric operations follow a single widening rule rather than a long per-operator list.
The hierarchy is:

`int -> real -> complex -> quaternion`

The result of a binary numeric operation is the widest numeric type present in the operands.
This means the following are the canonical cases:

- `int + int = int`
- `int + real = real`
- `real + real = real`
- `int + complex = complex`
- `real + complex = complex`
- `complex + complex = complex`
- `int + quaternion = quaternion`
- `real + quaternion = quaternion`
- `complex + quaternion = quaternion`
- `quaternion + quaternion = quaternion`

The same rule applies to subtraction, multiplication, and division among
numeric values. Exponentiation involving quaternions remains to be specified.
This gives a compact and predictable rule set without requiring every pairwise combination to be listed explicitly.

Examples:

- `2 + 2 = 4`
- `1 + 2.856295 = 3.856295`
- `2.52 + 2.48 = 5.0`
- `(2 + 52i) + (2 + 48i) = 4 + 100i`
- `1.79809804 + (2 + 8i) = 3.79809804 + 8i`
- `2 - 2 = 0`
- `1 - 2.856295 = -1.856295`
- `2.52 - 2.48 = 0.04`
- `(2 + 52i) - (2 + 48i) = 4i`
- `1.79809804 - (2 + 8i) = -0.20190196 - 8i`
- `2 * 2 = 4`
- `1 * 2.856295 = 2.856295`
- `2.52 * 2.48 = 6.2496`
- `(2 + 52i) * (2 + 48i) = -2492 + 200i`
- `1.79809804 * (2 + 8i) = 3.59619608 + 14.38478432i`
- `2 / 4 = 0.5`

This rule keeps the language consistent with the usual arithmetic hierarchy while separating numeric semantics from non-numeric operations such as string concatenation and tensor behavior.

The exact treatment of precision, overflow, integer division, and division by zero remains a design question to be resolved in the numeric model.

## Arithmetic operators

- `+` adds numeric values according to numeric promotion. `string + string`
  concatenates strings.
- `-` and `*` operate on numeric values according to numeric promotion.
- `/` operates on numeric values according to numeric promotion. Division of two
  integers yields a `real` result.
- `//` is integer division. It accepts integers only and returns an `int`.
  Its rounding rule for negative operands remains part of the numeric model.
- `%` is the integer remainder operator. It accepts integers only. For a positive
  divisor `b`, `a % b` is the unique remainder `r` such that
  `a = b * q + r` and `0 <= r < b`. Division by zero is an error.
- `^` is numeric exponentiation. It has a higher precedence than `*` and `/` and
  is right-associative: `2 ^ 3 ^ 2` means `2 ^ (3 ^ 2)`. Quaternion powers are
  defined in the **Quaternions** section.
- Unary `+value` and `-value` are supported for numeric values.
- `ln()` and `exp()` accept `int`, `real`, `complex`, and `quaternion` values.
  Quaternion semantics are defined in the **Quaternions** section.
- `abs()` accepts numeric values. It returns the modulus of a complex number and
  the norm of a quaternion, in both cases as a `real`.

The precise handling of non-integer powers, domains, precision, overflow, and
exceptional floating-point values remains part of the numeric model.

## Comparison operators

Onyx provides `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.

- Numeric comparisons apply numeric promotion, so `2 == 2.0` is `true`.
- Strings are compared by their contents.
- `none == none` is `true`.
- Ordering comparisons (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`) are invalid for `complex` and
  `quaternion`, because these types have no natural total order.
- Tensor comparison semantics are intentionally deferred.

## Boolean operators

Onyx uses keyword boolean operators:

```onyx
not active
is_admin and has_access
is_guest or is_admin
```

`and` and `or` use short-circuit evaluation. Conditions in `if`, `elif`, and
other control-flow constructs must evaluate to `bool`; values such as `0`, an
empty string, and an array are not implicitly converted to `bool`.

## Operator precedence

The currently defined precedence, from highest to lowest, is:

1. Function calls and indexing (indexing syntax remains open).
2. `^` (right-associative).
3. Unary `+` and unary `-`.
4. `*`, `/`, and `%`.
5. `+` and `-`.
6. `<`, `<=`, `>`, and `>=`.
7. `==` and `!=`.
8. `not`.
9. `and`.
10. `or`.

Arithmetic operators at the same precedence level are evaluated from left to
right, except `^`.

Array operations, including elementwise operations, matrix products, and
broadcasting, remain to be specified separately.

## Quaternions

A `quaternion` has four real components and is written mathematically as
`a + bi + cj + dk`. It extends `complex` through the subspace `a + bi`.

Quaternions are constructed with the canonical component order `(real, i, j, k)`:

```onyx
q: quaternion = quaternion(1, 2, 3, 4) (< 1 + 2i + 3j + 4k >)
```

The units follow the standard multiplication rules:

```text
i² = j² = k² = -1
ij = k, jk = i, ki = j
ji = -k, kj = -i, ik = -j
```

Quaternion multiplication is associative but not commutative. Therefore,
`a * b` and `b * a` must not be assumed equal when either operand is a
quaternion. The language fixes `i` as the complex unit embedded in a
quaternion, making promotion from `complex` to `quaternion` unambiguous.

`abs(q)` returns the real quaternion norm. Division by the zero quaternion is
an error.

`exp(q)` is defined for every quaternion. `ln(q)` is defined for every non-zero
quaternion and uses a deterministic principal branch. For a negative real value
represented as a quaternion, whose imaginary axis is otherwise ambiguous, the
principal logarithm uses the `i` axis:

```onyx
ln(quaternion(-2, 0, 0, 0)) (< ln(2) + πi >)
```

Quaternion powers accept integer and real exponents:

- `q ^ n`, where `n` is an `int`, uses integer powers; `q ^ 0` is the
  multiplicative identity `quaternion(1, 0, 0, 0)`.
- `q ^ r`, where `r` is a `real`, is defined as `exp(r * ln(q))` using the
  principal logarithm.
- A quaternion exponent is not supported in the first version.

A little remark: all mathematical operations listed here have exactly the same properties as the mathematical rules operate.
`token` and `map` are set aside for now -- to be introduced later once their syntax is decided.
